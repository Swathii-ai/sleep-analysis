## Sleep Efficiency Prediction Using Regression
## Overview

This project presents a regression-based approach to predict sleep efficiency using sleep behavior and lifestyle-related features. The objective is to analyze contributing factors that influence sleep quality and develop a predictive model using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of structured data capturing sleep and lifestyle attributes, including:

Sleep duration

Number of awakenings

Caffeine consumption

Alcohol intake

Physical activity frequency

Bedtime and sleep habits

## Methodology

Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations

Feature engineering and selection

Regression model development using Scikit-learn

Model evaluation using standard regression performance metrics

## Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## Results

The regression model provides insights into the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep efficiency. The results demonstrate how behavioral patterns impact sleep quality and highlight the effectiveness of regression techniques for health-related predictive analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases applied data science skills, including data analysis, regression modeling, and result interpretation, offering a practical example of using machine learning to derive insights from real-world data.
